## Hi there my name is Eduardo Lagarda ðŸ˜„
Years of achieving sales targets taught me the value of understanding customer behavior and market trendsâ€”skills Iâ€™m now leveraging in my data analysis career. Through dedicated training, Iâ€™ve mastered tools like SQL, Python, Tableau, allowing me to extract meaningful insights from data and translate them into actionable recommendations. I'm seeking a role where I can use my data analysis skills to contribute to strategic business decisions.
